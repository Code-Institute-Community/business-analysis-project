# Project Description

A Collaborative Open-Source Project where we are looking for a way to put regional Irish IT businesses into clusters based on their services/products. The information about their services/products should be found on their website, but are not in a format it can be used for applications.

# Challenge

- The primary challenge is to query an existing company name dataset, find their website, extract the relevant data which can be queried by search. 
i.e show all companies that offer IT Security services and display them on a map.

- The map should have the capacity to search, filter, zoom (etc.) by service offering, skillset, location and other overlapping factors.

- It should also have a view with different charts and analytics functionality which is gated by user authentication.

- It should also have an API to retrieve information about the categorisation of the businesses.

# Participation

Participation is open to all Code Institute students (who have passed project 2), alumni and staff.

# Participation Format

The project will initially be run over the course of the month of March 2022 with the option to be extended if need be.

In order to participate, you will need to [register your interest here](https://forms.gle/debegzf7oxufVXzR7). The registration will be closed a week before March 2022 and participation after that date will have to be reviewed on a case by case basis.

This project will be run very similar to the Hacktoberfest, the main difference being that this is an internal event which will not be advertised publicly.
